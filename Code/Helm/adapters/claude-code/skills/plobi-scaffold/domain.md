# Domain Docs

How the engineering skills should consume this repo's domain documentation when exploring the codebase.

## Before exploring, read these

- **`.ai/CONTEXT.md`** at the repo root, or
- **`.ai/CONTEXT-MAP.md`** at the repo root if it exists — it points at one `.ai/CONTEXT.md` per context. Read each one relevant to the topic.
- **`.ai/DECISIONS/`** — read ADRs that touch the area you're about to work in. In multi-context repos, also check `src/<context>/.ai/DECISIONS/` for context-scoped decisions.

If any of these files don't exist, **proceed silently**. Don't flag their absence; don't suggest creating them upfront. The producer skill (`/grill-with-docs`) creates them lazily when terms or decisions actually get resolved.

## File structure

Single-context repo (most repos):

```
/
├── .ai/
│   ├── CONTEXT.md
│   └── DECISIONS/
│       ├── ADR-0001-event-sourced-orders.md
│       └── ADR-0002-postgres-for-write-model.md
└── src/
```

Multi-context repo (presence of `.ai/CONTEXT-MAP.md` at the root):

```
/
├── .ai/
│   ├── CONTEXT-MAP.md
│   └── DECISIONS/                          ← system-wide decisions
└── src/
    ├── ordering/
    │   ├── .ai/
    │   │   ├── CONTEXT.md
    │   │   └── DECISIONS/             ← context-specific decisions
    │   └── ...
    └── billing/
        ├── .ai/
        │   ├── CONTEXT.md
        │   └── DECISIONS/
        └── ...
```

## Use the glossary's vocabulary

When your output names a domain concept (in an issue title, a refactor proposal, a hypothesis, a test name), use the term as defined in `.ai/CONTEXT.md`. Don't drift to synonyms the glossary explicitly avoids.

If the concept you need isn't in the glossary yet, that's a signal — either you're inventing language the project doesn't use (reconsider) or there's a real gap (note it for `/grill-with-docs`).

## Flag ADR conflicts

If your output contradicts an existing ADR, surface it explicitly rather than silently overriding:

> _Contradicts ADR-0007 (event-sourced orders) — but worth reopening because…_
